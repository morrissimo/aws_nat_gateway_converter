# aws_nat_gateway_converter

I want to thank [Coin Graham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coingraham) for inspiring me to do this.  It was really all his idea.  I just thought I would give it a try.

BETA:

This simple Python application will make use of the [New AWS Managed NAT service](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-managed-nat-network-address-translation-gateway-for-aws/).  It will remove old NAT instances, clean up the route tables, deploy a new NAT gateway, and update the route tables with the new Managed Service.  Optionally, there is the ability to allocate an EIP to the service.  

Requirements:
* Python 2.7
* AWS CLI
* AWS boto3 library
* IAM keys with rights to VPC/EC2 - pretty much full rights
* run 'aws config' and put in key/secret
